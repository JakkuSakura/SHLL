# lang-core

lang-core contains mainly AST of SHLL

## Boxing

Boxing/interning inside AST is a trade-off between performance and ergonomics.

```rust
enum Expression {
    Variant(Struct)
}

struct Struct {
    expression: Box<Expression> //, or just AExpr
}
```

1. has better performance and egonomics

So the rules are:

1. Box will only appear in enum
2. Use enum directly without considering Box
3. Make sure enum is thin enough to pass around

## TODO

1. [ ] support unsafe and pointers via virtual machine
2. [ ] evaluate kinda complex rust std types
3. [x] new code structure:
    ```text
    id/{path, id, hash} -> refers to other expr/value/ty nodes
    expr/{if, for, etc} -> AST nodes that generates an typed value, living in lifted code universe
    expr/ty -> special AST node that generates type
    value/{struct, enum, etc} -> value living in memory universe
    value/ty -> type in memory
    ty/{int, float, etc} -> type living in type universe
    ```
4. [ ] use ids, instead of `Box<T>`
5. [ ] query-driven system like rustc
